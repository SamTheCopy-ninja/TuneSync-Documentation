Data Collection and Security Policy for TuneSync

Last Updated: 30 October 2024

TuneSync (“we,” “us,” or “our”) respects your privacy and is committed to ensuring transparency in data collection and security. This document outlines the types of data collected, security practices, and instructions for requesting data deletion.

1. Data Collection
TuneSync collects minimal data necessary to provide a secure and seamless experience.

User Authentication Information:

Email and Password: If you choose to create an account with TuneSync, we collect and store your email and password through Firebase Authentication, a secure third-party service.
Biometric Data (Fingerprint): As an alternative to passwords, users can sign in using fingerprint biometrics stored locally on their device. Note that fingerprint data is never shared with us and remains on your device.  


Additional Data Collected:

Local Audio Files: TuneSync accesses your device’s audio files but does not store, upload, or transmit this data outside your device.  
API Data: TuneSync uses third-party APIs to retrieve lyrics and concert events. These API queries are made without collecting or transmitting personal data.  

2. Security  
TuneSync employs Firebase Authentication to manage and secure user credentials. Firebase complies with industry-standard security practices, including encryption of data in transit and at rest.

3. Requesting Account and Data Deletion
To request the deletion of your account and associated data, please follow the steps below:

Contact Us: Send an email to `samkelostts@gmail.com` with the subject line “Account Deletion Request - TuneSync” and include the email address associated with your TuneSync account.

Data Deleted  
Once we receive your deletion request, we will:

Permanently delete your email and password stored in Firebase Authentication, and notify you once this action has been completed.  
Data Retention: No additional data is stored or retained beyond your authentication credentials, which are deleted promptly upon request.

Note: Biometric sign-in data (fingerprint) is managed by your device’s operating system and cannot be accessed or deleted by TuneSync.
