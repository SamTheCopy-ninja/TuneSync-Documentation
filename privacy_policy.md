TuneSync is designed as an offline music player. We collect minimal information, focused on functionality and user experience:

Local Music Files: TuneSync accesses audio files stored on your device via MediaStore. These files remain on your device, and we do not collect, upload, or store them.  

Lyrics Search: When you search for song lyrics, we use a third-party API to retrieve lyrics information. This query is made without collecting personal data, only the song details are used to construct the search query.  

Concert Events Search: Similarly, when you search for concert events, we query an external API. No personal information about you is sent to these third parties, only the event search parameters you provided are part of the query.  

2. Permissions

TuneSync requests the following permissions:

Storage Access: Required to retrieve and play audio files stored on your device.
Push Notifications: Used to send notifications about new features, updates, or relevant content. You can opt out of these notifications in your device settings.  

3. Information Sharing and Disclosure

TuneSync does not share your data with third-party advertisers. External API calls (for lyrics and concert events) are made anonymously and do not transmit any identifying information.

4. Security

We use industry-standard security practices to protect your data and ensure that no information from your device is stored or transmitted externally.
